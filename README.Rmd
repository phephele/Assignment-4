## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. she's the collest cat in town.

#Chunk 1
## Null hypothesis
* The Chicks' weights are not dependent on the feed

## Alternative Hyphothesis
* The chicks' weights are dependent on the feed
```{r data_import, data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
x <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")
View(x)
boxplot(x$weight~x$feed)

#anova test
 chickanova<-aov(weight~feed, data = x)
 summary(chickanova)
 
#Degrees of freedom and p value
 df = 5
 'p < 0.05'
"Accept null hypothesis"


```

# Chunk 2
## Null hypothesis
* Drinking contaminated water does not cause gastroenteritis

## Alternative Hypothesis
* Drinking contaminated water causes gastroenteritis
```{r  echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
s<- read.csv("gastroenteritis (1).csv")
s1<- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data = s)
s1

barplot(s1, beside = TRUE, ylab = "Water Consumption (glasses/day)", xlab = "Clinical Presentation", main = "Relationship between Water Consumption and the presentation of Gastroenteritis", col = c("blue", "maroon", "grey"))
legend("top", c("<1 glasses/day", ">4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), fill = c("blue", "maroon", "grey"))

#chi squared test
s2<-chisq.test(s1, correct = TRUE)
s2


```
#chi squared test assumptions
* Two catergorical variables 
* Determine the realationship between two variables# We reject the null hypothesis because p<0.05

* We reject the null hypothesis because p<0.05

***

#Chunk 3
## Null Hypothesis
* Chemotherapy does not cause nausea

## Alternative Hypothesis
* Chemotherapy causes nausea

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
d <- read.csv("nausea.csv")

#The nausea scale ranges from 0 to 6, thereefore the last reading might have been an error. I have changed to to 4 to have it align with the other readings.

d[8,3]=4
d

#Plotting the data

plot(d$Nausea_before~d$Patient, type = "l", xlab ="Patients", ylab = "Nausea Rating", ylim= c(0,6))
lines(d$Nausea_after~d$Patient, col= "green")

legend("top", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"), fill = c("black", "green"))

#Wilcox test
wilcox.test(d$Nausea_before, d$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)



```

## Underlying Assumption
* Paired and non-parametric data.

* P value<0.05, therefore we reject the null hypothesis.

#Assignment 6

#Chunk 1
##Null Hypothesis
* There is no association between the median house prices and the interest rates.  

##Alternative Hypothesis
* There is an association between the median house prices and the interest rates.


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}
housing <- read.csv('housing-prices.csv')
housing

#scatter plot
plot(x=housing$interest_rate, y=housing$median_house_price_USD, ylab = 'Median House Price (USD)', xlab = 'Interest Rate', main = 'Relatinship between Housing Prices and Interest Rates.', pch = 19, col = 'red')
abline( lm(housing$median_house_price_USD ~ housing$interest_rate, data= housing), lwd = 2, col = 'navy')


#linear regression
housing.reg <- lm(housing$median_house_price_USD ~ housing$interest_rate, data= housing)
summary(housing.reg)

#diagnostic plot 1-qqplot
qqnorm(housing.reg$residuals, pch = 19)
qqline(housing.reg$residuals, col = 'grey', lwd = 3)

#diagnostic plot 2-homoskedasticity
plot(x=housing.reg$fitted.values, y=housing.reg$residuals, col = 'purple', main = 'Fitted Values vs Residuals', xlab = 'Fitted Values', ylab = 'Residuals')
abline(h = 0, col = 'pink')

#generalised linear regression
housing.reg2 <- glm(housing$median_house_price_USD ~ housing$interest_rate, data= housing)
summary(housing.reg2)




```

##Linear regression Assumptions
* The residuals are normally distributed
* x variable was measured with no error
* There is a linear trend between x and y

##Diagnostics
* The residuals dont appear to be normally distributed as most of the points dont fall within the line.
* The variance of the residuals increases as the fitted values increase. The residuals are heteroskedastic, thus violating the assumptions for linear regression. 

* I have used a generalised linear regression instead.



##Outcomes
* df=15
* p=0.02
* we reject the null hypothesis. There is an inverse association between the median house prices and the interest rates.
